<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
Welcome to DOVES! If you are here you are probably interested in bird watching and would like to submit<br> information about the rare birds you have seen. The purpose behind DOVES is to serve as a repository for all <br>rare bird sightings in Virginia.  In order to have your sighting catalogued on our server, there are a few steps you<br> need to follow.  Once you’ve gone through this tutorial, you’ll be able to submit sightings at your leisure in the future.

The first thing you need to do is create a user account to log in with. This is necessary because you cannot<br> make a bird sighting submission without being logged in. Clicking on the “Register User” link on the left side<br> of the screen will allow you to do this. To create a user account you need to use a valid email address and<br> password for the system to create the new user account/password combination. All other personal information<br>fields (First name, Last name, Address, etc.) are not required to log in.

Once you have successfully created a user account you will be able to make a submission. You start <br>to make a submission by clicking the “Submit” link on the left side of the screen. Note that if you have not yet<br> successfully logged into DOVES and attempt to make a submission you will be redirected to the log in screen.<br> If you are successfully logged in, however, you will be directed to the submission form. All fields in the submission<br> form are required to be filled out in order to complete your submission. If you do not know what should be entered<br> for a particular field you can write something like “I don’t know” in any of the fields in the form. When you have<br> completed the form, you may click the “Submit” link at the bottom of the page. <br>

Once you have successfully submitted the form, it will be placed in a voting system, in which the members<br> of VARCOM will look at your submission and decide if they want it to be included in the permanent records. Your<br> submission should be about birds located in Virginia. You can log out and log back in periodically to see if VARCOM<br> has made a decision regarding your bird sighting submission.
