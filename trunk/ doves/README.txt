1) About DOVES
--------------
DOVES (the Database for Ornithological VErification and Submission) is a project 
dedicated to automating the process of submitting and reviewing bird sightings for 
the Virginia Avian Records Committee (VARCOM).

The DOVES team is made up of seven computer science students currently attending 
Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. By the end of the 2013 Spring 
semester we seek to have a prototype product in working order.
