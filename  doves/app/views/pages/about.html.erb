<h1>We are DOVES!</h1>
<p>
We are the CS 411 blue team and we are the group responsible for designing the Database for VErification and Submission, otherwise known as DOVES.
The purpose is to provide a database for the submission of rare bird findings in the state of Virginia.
Dr. Ake has acted as a mentor for our project and we are very grateful for his advice in order to complete our first working prototype throughout the school year.
