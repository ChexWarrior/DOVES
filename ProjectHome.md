DOVES (the Database for Ornithological VErification and Submission) is a project dedicated to automating the process of submitting and reviewing bird sightings for the Virginia Avian Records Committee (VARCOM).

The DOVES team is made up of seven computer science students currently attending Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.  By the end of the 2013 Spring semester we seek to have a prototype product in working order.
